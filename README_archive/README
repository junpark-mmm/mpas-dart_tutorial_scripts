# MPAS/DART Cycling
====================

This README describes a workflow at each analysis cycle with the input and output
files specified for two ensemble members.

For high-level data assimilation workflows in DART or the output files from filter 
(e.g., files listed in `stages_to_write` in &filter_nml), see 
https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/stable/guide/high-level-da-workflows.html.

Two more READMEs are provided in this directory:
README.regional_mpas for regional MPAS modeling,
README.init_ensemble for creating initial ensemble before cycling.

    <filter> - produces the EnKF analyses

       |
       | as input_file_list in &update_mpas_states_nml
       V
<update_mpas_states> - updates analysis vector in MPAS restart files for all members
       |
       | as output_file_list in &update_mpas_states_nml
       V
"filter_in.txt" : member1/restart.nc
       |          member2/restart.nc
       | same as input_state_file_list in &filter_nml
       | (Warning: restart.nc are overwritten for analysis fields.)
       V
advance_model.csh ensemble_member_number
(to run the MPAS model for each member with the member#/restart.nc until the next analysis time;
 the resulting member#/restart.nc will be used as input to filter at the next analysis cycle)


# Regional MPAS/DART
---------------------
For regional cycling, <update_bc> should be conducted right after <update_mpas_states>
but before running advance_model.csh, with the namelist as below.

&update_bc_nml
  update_analysis_file_list           = 'filter_out.txt'
  update_boundary_file_list           = 'boundary_inout.txt'

Warning: lbc files listed in boundary_inout.txt will be overwritten (like restart.nc).

| filename       | purpose                                                           |
+================+======-============================================================+
| input.nml      | to read the namelist - model_mod_nml and mpas_vars_nml            |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| restart.nc     | An MPAS restart file for each member, used as input (prior)       |
|                | for filter and output (analysis) for the next model run           |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| analysis.ncÂ    | time-variant analysis state (for each member) after assimilation  |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mpas_init.nc   | init_template_filename for static info (ex. grid dimensions)      |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note 1: File names in filter_out.txt are editable by users 
        as long as they remain the same throughout the cycles.
     2: restart.nc can be replaced by init.nc for the very first cycle.
     3: For the model run in each member directory, ensure streams.atmosphere 
        (for the model I/O streams) defines the output_interval for the restart files
        as the cycling frequency (ex. output_interval="06:00:00" for 6-h cycling).
     4: The restart file name defined in filter_in.txt for each member should match 
        the restart filename_template defined in streams.atmosphere.
     5: lbc files defined in boundary_inout.txt should match filename_template for "lbc_in" 
        in streams.atmosphere.
